Classes under development:
- TrafficDataClasses


Nov 12 updates:
1. Added a few statistic analysis functions: plotting the time series and the 2d map of the pixels.


TODO:
1. Integrate Fangyuâ€™s parser in the class
2. add default values for the arguments for easier use
3. plot the heat map


Issue:
1. plot_time_series_for_pixel: plots three figures incrementally with more lines, instead of just one figure with all lines.
